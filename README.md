Hello, this repo is a place for me to upload any code that is related to my learning and understanding of machine learning. Most of these are tutorials that I followed or homework from my course that I am taking on machine learning. If something is my own project, I will note it explicitly. 

Thanks for checking it out. These tutorials can be found on DataQuest's Youtube channel, found here: https://www.youtube.com/@Dataquestio
